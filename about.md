Hi there, I'm Alex from Jalisco, MÃ©xico. I studied Computer Engineering at
the University of Guadalajara. Actually, I'm working as a software developer.

When I'm not at work I enjoy playing soccer, spending time with my family,
drinking a beer with friends, listening to music and occasionally playing
a good chess game.

I'll be sharing not only things about tech I learn working but also stuff
I consider important or I just like.
